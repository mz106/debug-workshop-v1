Debug Workshop V1

Introduction

Given that software development is essentially an exercise in problem 
solving, this is the first of a series of workshops concerning a methodological 
approach to solving problems encountered whilst developing software.
This is presented in the form of a simple (yet hopefully challenging) exercise 
in debugging, aimed at Masters students circa week three. 


Aim

The purpose is to teach and give practice in problem-solving methods 
and to familarise students with the error stack and debugging techniques, 
and instill a sense of teamwork.

Method

After a brief introduction from the instructor, students will be 
placed into teams in which they shall run the program and read the error
stack. From here, they shall atempt to resolve the first bugs. An 
instructor(s) will be on hand to offer guidance, but NOT to resolve the
issue for the students. 

Once the teams have a fully working program, a retro will be help, 
concerning both the techniques that they have used, and the quality
of the workshop itself.
